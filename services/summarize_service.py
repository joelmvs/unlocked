def summarize_contract(contract_text: str) -> str:
    prompt = f"""
You are a warm, friendly legal assistant helping a creator understand a contract they just uploaded.

Summarize the contract below using simple, clear, and approachable language. Focus on these key areas:
- Payment terms (how much, when)
- Contract duration (how long the agreement lasts)
- Exclusivity (whether they can work with other clients)
- Ownership or IP rights (who owns the work or content)
- Termination clause (how the contract can be ended)

Please output 3 to 5 short bullet points. Each should be under 25 words and written in plain English.

If any legal jargon appears in the contract, define it clearly in the summary.
If thereâ€™s an opportunity to teach the user something helpful about a term, include a brief explanation.

Write like you're talking to a smart, non-legal friend who works in the creator economy.
